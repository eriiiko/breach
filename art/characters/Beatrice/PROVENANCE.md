# Beatrice — scripted Blender model (Claude), stage 1

2026-10-04. Tracker: eriiiko/breach #33. Branch `33-beatrice`. Offline asset files only. This stage:
body, bodysuit, hands and boots; the head is a bald placeholder (collection `Head`, objects
`Beatrice_Head`, `_Eye_L/R`, `_Ear`) for the later face-and-hair stage. No rig, no game file yet.

## Source and scope

- References, supplied by Erik (1024 x 1536 each); where they come from is not recorded here:
  - `concept.jfif` — the original artwork, three-quarter front, walking, cropped at the crotch. SHA-256
    `39770a90e118be1589fdfcbce4b691fbacacddf00abfc47a96129da35dcd25d4`.
  - `without_hair.png` — front view in the modelling pose (redrawn from the concept by an image model). SHA-256
    `e50b669f5fe177c219896d8c65b06947ce368cc2a0336ad483e7a04884836dc2`.
  - `with_hair.png` — the same with hair (for the next stage). SHA-256
    `7be681b2d6861440a265cea25e070b03d048be6a4af5ca35623a78c8a829b40c`.
- Erik's steer: heights, limbs, shoulders, arms, torso above the waist, knees and below from the front
  view; hips, seat and thighs from the concept (the front view's are too wide); the front view's
  full-length suit. 1.68 m to the top of the head, boots on. No side or back reference exists.
- No third-party geometry, textures or code.

## Reproduce

Blender 4.5, bundled Python. From `art/characters/`:

    bash charkit/run.sh Beatrice --sheet --turn --beauty all --save     # about 2.3 minutes
    bash charkit/run.sh Beatrice --sheet --shape sheet_hips --save      # the front view's hips, about 15 s
    bash charkit/run.sh Beatrice --variant crimson --beauty hero         # about 20 s
    bash charkit/run.sh Beatrice --compare                               # shape_vs_concept.jpg, about 30 s
    bash charkit/run.sh Beatrice --draft --sheet                         # about 15 s, the working loop

Outputs: `previews/` (tracked), `source/Beatrice.blend` (gitignored), `source/*mesh_stats.json`,
`source/*sheet_scores.json` (tracked).

## How it is built

- `scripts/beatrice.py` — the tables: `PALETTE`, `GLOSS`, `VARIANTS`, `LEGS` / `HIPS` / `TORSO` (the trunk
  rows), `SHAPES` (row overrides: `sheet_hips`), `CONCEPT` (the measured ratios), `SLEEVE`, `dims()`,
  `HEAD`, `BEAUTY`, `DEV_VIEWS`, `BANDS`. `scripts/sheet_ref.py` — the front view's pixel frame and the
  concept's placement. `scripts/build.py` — three lines over `charkit/suitbuild.py`.
- Shared kit, new: `charkit/bodysuit.py` (the skin-tight figure on the workers' `workwear.Figure`
  construction: half-body trunk loft welded at the mid-plane, set-in sleeve with the armhole envelope,
  plus body forms, signed `pipe` seams, mesh panels, stand collar, zip, cuffs, knee pads, heeled ankle
  boots) and `charkit/suitbuild.py` (its driver: band IoU, proportion ratios, shape variants, the
  concept comparison). Additive changes: `garment.panel` (a panel of any curved outline, CDT-triangulated),
  `wearmat.mat_gloss` / `mat_mesh`, `sheetfit.Sheet(fill_holes=, floor=)` (defaults unchanged).
- Materials: `beatrice_suit`, `beatrice_mesh`, `beatrice_skin`, `beatrice_eye`, `beatrice_boot`,
  `beatrice_sole`, `beatrice_metal`.

## Measured

- Concept (by hand, far-side half-widths from the midline, concept px): shoulder 305, waist 155, hip at
  the crotch 278, far thigh at the crotch 268 → hip/shoulder 0.911, hip/waist 1.794, thigh/hip 0.482.
- Front view (measured by the driver): hip/shoulder 0.991, hip/waist 2.044, thigh/hip 0.461.
- Default build: hip/shoulder 0.909 (−0.2 %), hip/waist 1.840 (+2.6 %), thigh/hip 0.463 (−3.9 %).
- Silhouette IoU against the front view, default: whole 0.913; above the waist 0.963, waist–knee 0.873,
  knees down 0.924. `sheet_hips`: 0.948; 0.963 / 0.949 / 0.924.
- `source/mesh_stats.json`: 34 objects, 372,396 source / 1,076,652 evaluated triangles; all 34 closed and
  facing outward.

## Not done, and known weaknesses

See the stage-1 report in issue #33. The face is the head function's default (doll-like); side and back
are invented; the mesh inserts' net moirés at full-figure distance.
