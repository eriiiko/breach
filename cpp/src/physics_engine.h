// PhysicsEngine — owns the (stateless, const-step) solver instances.
//
// engine/02: "the physics engine CONTAINS the grid owner" — this is the C++
// home the CUDA port plugs into. Patch 1 S3 is the SCAFFOLD: the engine owns the
// solvers' lifetime + their tunable params; the per-tick orchestration (the
// substep loop, the W3/W5 glue) moves INTO this class in S4. The solvers are
// genuinely stateless (every step() is const; scratch is the reused mutable
// members from S2), so the engine just holds them and exposes references — no
// arithmetic lives here yet, so S3 is bit-identical by construction.
//
// NOTE (engine/02 + the unification plan v2 §3a): the engine does NOT cache
// field pointers. The solvers re-fetch each numpy array's raw pointer per step()
// (the pybind get_2d pattern), so the engine is robust to GameMap reallocation
// on reset() and to in-place field rewrites. The engine owns SOLVERS, not grids
// (yet); grid residency is a later (GPU) patch.
